<!-- ========================
STUDENT DIRECTORIES:
In order to add a student you will need to open studentinfo.html and then
put a breakline in front of your student entry.  Breaklines should only
be used when you are done with a piece of information or are starting a new student.
For labels, put a colon after your label text.  Students must be written in Name,
Instrument, Additional Info order.

EXAMPLE BELOW...

Student Name
Instrument
Hometown: HOMETOWN
Hobbies: HOBBY
Quote: The whole quote must be on one line.  It will wrap automatically when displayed but here it must be on one line.

DETAILED EXPLANATION
The doublebreakline is what the program uses to determine new students.
The colon denotes a field label, which allows the program to style it accordingly.
The first single breakline denotes the student name.  Then their instrument.
After the first two breakline, the program considers each breakline the end of 
a field of information (like hobby) or if there are double breaks, the end of a student's info.

Note: The first student should not have a breakline in front.

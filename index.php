			<h4>Prospective Students</h4>
			The Low Brass Studio at the University of North Carolina is an artistically and intellectually 
			diverse community committed toward the common goals of a greater understanding of music and 
			brilliant performance.  Despite the fact that UNC has an enrollment of nearly 23,000 students, 
			the Music Department keeps an intimate and inclusive style of teaching with a performance program 
			completely focused on undergraduate students. These are just a few of the things that make low brass
			study at Carolina unique.  If have further questions or would like to set up a lesson or a campus 
			visit, please give me a call or send an email.  I look forward to meeting you and helping you reach your potential.
